This is the Hangman project, it's a game where the goal is to guess a word with a limited number of attempts.
The project is in a very advanced stage of completion. To run the program you just have to execute the file main.go.
In this program we use the programming languages Golang, Html and CSS. We use the technology of cookies, images placed
on a remote server, as well as the Http library that allows to make a localhost. In this project we import the 
Hangman-Classic project to use it in our web version. It is possible that when updating the cache of your browser 
prevents the execution of the new CSS. This program belongs to its authors BRUN Sasha, ANDRE Edgar and BREVIERE LÃ©o.
